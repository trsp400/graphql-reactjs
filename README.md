# Challenge

This repository is a challenge that consists in a simple web app that uses graphql to fetch data from SpaceX API.

## How to run

Steps:

1. run `yarn` to install the dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to run the app

#### Ta-Da!

- The app is up and running on http://localhost:3000

## Deploy

1.Every time a push on any branch is made, vercel deploys on a new URL,
but for you to get this brand new URL(it is equivalent to homologation environment), you need to create a pull request to branch `develop`.
So after the pull request is merged, vercel bot comments on it, adding the new URL.
2.After being merged into master, the project will run on -> https://softplan-challenge.vercel.app
